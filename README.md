# Flight-scheduler
A rudimentary flight scheduler

## Introduction :

* The subject of the project is to compute the least priced flights between a given period of time and locations with the Java programming language version ---.  

* A set of input of flight schedules of the form : `City1 | City2 | Departure-time | Arrival-time | Flight-no. | Price` is ingested. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, formed a network of interconnected flights to compute least priced flight plan (for a single query or multiple queries ingested all at once) within a given time frame from one city to another or negates if there exists no schedule.
